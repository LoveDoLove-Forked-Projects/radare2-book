## IOLI CrackMes

The Ioli Crackmes are a series of reverse engineering exercises designed by Pau Oliva Fora for users of Radare1, this revision is up to date with the latest version of Radare2.

These exercises are intended to help you learn and practice reverse engineering techniques using Radare2. Each crackme is a self-contained challenge that requires you to analyze and understand executable files, gradually building your skills as you progress.

Each crackme in the series is slightly more difficult than the previous one, introducing new concepts and commands at a manageable pace. This incremental difficulty helps ease the learning process, ensuring that you gain a solid understanding of basic techniques before moving on to more complex tasks. As you advance, you will become more proficient in using Radare2 and develop a deeper understanding of reverse engineering principles.

Every crackme is presented in three sections:

* An introduction that explains the challenge to be solved,
* Hints that provide guidance on useful commands and steps to follow
* Solution section that offers a step-by-step guide to solving the challenge.

This structured approach ensures that you not only learn how to solve each specific crackme but also understand the underlying concepts and methodologies, allowing you to apply these skills to other reverse engineering tasks in the future.
